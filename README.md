> :sparkles: Feb/10 2018 :sparkles: We use [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)!

# Step 1

Use Bundler to mange our gems. So we need create a [Gemfile for Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).

# Step 2

Install Jekyll and dependencies.

```
bundle install
```

# step 3

Preview and trouble shooting.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
